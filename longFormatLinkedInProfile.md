[ LAST UPDATED: November 18, 2025 ]

I am a technology leader and strategic advisor with 20+ years of experience delivering products, platforms, and AI-driven solutions across Fortune 500 companies, global nonprofits, and high-growth startups. I currently work as faculty at PES University. My professional experience spans software engineering, digital strategy, full-stack architecture, and applied AI/ML — backed by roles at Microsoft, Oracle, and multiple CTO and advisory positions.

Across my career, I’ve led engineering teams, built scalable systems, designed data and AI capabilities, and guided organizations through digital and organizational change. I bring a systems mindset shaped by hands-on technical depth, product clarity, and strategic execution.

My experience ranges from building performance-critical database engine components at Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle’s Server Technologies division, to architecting secure platforms for startups and non-profits in agritech, edtech, media, and analytics. As a CTO and Fractional CTO, I’ve directed product strategy, technology roadmaps, and cross-functional delivery across engineering, analytics, marketing, and customer teams.

I also bring an academic and research dimension: teaching Data, Analytics, AI, and Behavioral Science; publishing 10+ books; and developing new theoretical frameworks across political science, economics, and philosophy. This background enables me to blend engineering rigor, analytical thinking, and creative problem-solving in complex environments.

Today, I work at the intersection of **AI strategy**, **product innovation**, **engineering leadership**, and **decision intelligence** — helping organizations design scalable architectures, modernize platforms, and navigate the opportunities and risks of AI. I am passionate about building systems, tools, and ideas that make organizations more capable, resilient, and humane.
