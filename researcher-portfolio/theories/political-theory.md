# Political Theory

This document outlines a new political theory I have developed — a framework designed to re-examine how nations, cultures, and global systems interact in the 21st century. It is intended as both a critique of, and a successor to, some of the most influential traditions in modern political thought.

In particular, the theory responds directly to:

- **Samuel Huntington’s** *Clash of Civilizations*  
- **Karl Marx’s** theories of class, conflict, and historical progression

Rather than interpreting global dynamics through civilizational conflict or economic determinism, this new theory offers a more nuanced, flexible, and human-centered model for understanding change, identity, and power.

A complete manuscript is available upon request.
