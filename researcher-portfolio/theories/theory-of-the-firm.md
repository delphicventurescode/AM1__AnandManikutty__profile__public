# Theory of the Firm

This section presents an overview of a **new Theory of the Firm** that I have developed — a modern rethinking of how businesses create, organize, and sustain value. The theory challenges several long-standing assumptions in economics and strategic management by offering a more human-centered, dynamic, and systems-oriented perspective.

The work positions itself as an alternative to classic frameworks such as:

- **Ronald Coase’s** transaction-cost theory of the firm  
- **Oliver Williamson’s** work on organizational economics and governance

While these foundational theories focus on cost minimization, contracts, and hierarchical efficiency, this new model proposes a broader lens — one that incorporates:

- Behavioral and emotional drivers  
- Information flow and cognitive constraints  
- Technological acceleration  
- Collective identity and organizational purpose  
- Dynamic value creation across ecosystems

The goal of the theory is to explain not just *why firms exist*, but *how they evolve*, *why they behave the way they do*, and *what enables them to thrive* in environments shaped by rapid change, complexity, and uncertainty.

A full manuscript detailing the theory is available upon request.
